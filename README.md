# Preva â€“ Breast Cancer Risk Calculator from Gene Expression Data
## Project Overview
Preva is an interactive risk calculator that predicts breast cancer severity from gene expression data.
This app was developed as a group project for DATA3888 (2025 S1) at the University of Sydney. (data3888-group07)

It is designed as a modular educational tool that guides users from raw data to prediction, helping students and learners explore key bioinformatics workflows in a hands-on way.

## Key Features
Module 1: Introduction to Breast Cancer & GED

Module 2: Data Upload and Processing (batch correction, resampling, filtering)

Module 3: Predictive Model Building (SVM, KNN, RF with tunable parameters)

Module 4: Risk Evaluation & Interpretation
(Accuracy, F1, Kappa, ROC/AUC, confusion matrix, top genes)
